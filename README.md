## Introduction

_The rising prevalence of obesity is a significant global health concern, associated with increased risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. Early identification of individuals at risk of obesity based on lifestyle factors can support preventive interventions and personalized health guidance. Our project addresses this issue by developing a predictive tool that estimates obesity levels from eating habits and physical condition. We will use the “Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (ref. 3; 1). As mentioned before, it contains over 2,000 observations and 17 features including one outcome variable as obesity levels. Importantly, this dataset has already been applied in previous study, demonstrating its validity and utility as a tool for developing predictive models of obesity and related health outcomes._

## Goals and aims

_Our goals are: (i) conduct descriptive and diagnostic analyses to characterize lifestyle patterns across obesity categories; (ii) train and validate ML classifiers (e.g., random forest, SVMs) to estimate obesity levels; (iii) quantify feature importance to locate risk factors; and (iv) expose predictions, explanations, and what-if exploration via an interactive dashboard._
